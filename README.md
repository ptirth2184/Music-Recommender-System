# Music Recommender System

## Overview
The **Music Recommender System** is a Python-based project that suggests songs to users based on their preferences and listening history. The system leverages machine learning and natural language processing techniques to deliver accurate and personalized recommendations. Additionally, it integrates with Spotify to enhance its capabilities.

## Features
- Personalized song recommendations.
- Integration with Spotify for real-time data.
- User-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.
- Efficient handling of large datasets using pandas.
- Machine learning models for music preference prediction.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text-based analysis.

## Tech Stack
The project is built using the following Python libraries:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **sklearn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive web application.
- **pickle**: For saving and loading models efficiently.
- **nltk**: For text processing and natural language tasks.
- **Spotify API**: For fetching song details and user data.
